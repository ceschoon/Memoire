Remarks concerning the data
===========================



1) General remarks
------------------

The data presented here contains results from computations using either 
numeric or analytic evaluation of weights. There is little difference 
except for sensitive quantities like the vacancy concentration or the
free energy difference between FCC and HCP configurations. The presented
data comes from analytic calculations only when it was necessary.



2) Coexistence curves
---------------------

The files "coexCurvesXX_potential_cutoff.dat" contain physical properties
at coexistance, as a function of the temperature.



3) Vacancy concentration
------------------------

3.1) From gaussian dft calculations
...................................

See "Cvac" column in the files "coexCurvesXX_potential_cutoff.dat".

At low temperatures, vacancy concentrations are very small and are 
affected by interpolation errors. The corresponding points can be removed
from the data set or this should be discussed in the image caption.

3.2) From simulations
.....................

Simulation results from purohit et al. (2018) are reported in the file
"simulation_vacancies_LJ.dat". The vacancy concentration is 'phi' and 
the temperature is 'T'.

3.3) From older DFT calculations
................................

See files "mcrae1990.dat" and "singh2007.dat" 



4) FCC-HCP free energy differences
----------------------------------

See files "FCCvsHCP_potential_cutoff.dat". 

The new data for the colloid case confirms that the free energy difference
is very small. It is about the order of magnitude of the interpolation 
errors, so at this level of precision we can not tell which configuration
is the most stable.
